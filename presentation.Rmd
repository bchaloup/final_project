## Dwelling on Complexity with Dynamic Fractals

How much time will participants spend looking at dynamic fractals as they increase or decrease in complexity?

## Challenges along the way
- Working with Git
  - Figuring out best practices for collaboration
- Working with GGPlot
  - Getting figures to display the right data
- Not getting distracted by all the pretty fractals

## Victories and celebrations
- We made our presentation in R
- We made a lot of sweet plots
- We worked well as a team
- I came away from this project knowing more about R than I did before

## Remaining Challenges
- Touching up some plots
- Getting more efficient using Git

## Next R hurdle to tackle
- Use functions we learned in class on my own data
- Get better at commenting my code

## Challenges along the way
- Technological issues 
  - Version control
  - Multi OS nomenclature
  - Error bars

## Victories and and celebrations
- Technological work arounds
  - More familiar with path settings
  - General code interpretation and debugging improvements 
  
## Remaining Challenges
- Fluid coding
- More error feed back comprehension 

## Next R hurdle to tackle
- Using R to analyze data collected in MATLAB
- Using R for my master's project

::::

## Victories and celebrations
- making GIFs
- super neat plots
- proof of concept and task
- research question was answered
- hypothesis was correct
- using R to make this presentation

## Next R hurdle to tackle
- remove outliers and re-run analysis
- run a power analysis
- work with the "random" data
- make some plots prettier

## Remaining Challenges
- adapt and develop the study
- run an online study
- 3D dynamic fractals
- replicate with cellular automata

# Project Background and Introduction

## What are fractals?

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

:::{}
- Invented by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980
- *"Clouds are not spheres. Mountains are not cones."*
- Measure of "roughness" called dimension
- Self similarity and scale invariance
- Mathematically or algorithmically generated
