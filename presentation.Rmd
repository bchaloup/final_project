## Dwelling on Complexity with Dynamic Fractals

How much time will participants spend looking at dynamic fractals as they increase or decrease in complexity?

# Ben "Turtles all the way down," Chaloupka

## Challenges faced along the way
- Working with Git
  - Figuring out best practices for collaboration
- Working with GGPlot
  - Getting figures to display the right data
- Not getting distracted by all the pretty fractals

## Victories and things to celebrate
- We made our presentation in R
- We made a lot of sweet plots
- We worked well as a team
- I came away from this project knowing more about R than I did before

## Challenges you are still facing
- Touching up some plots
- Getting more efficient using Git

## Next R hurdle to tackle
- Use functions we learned in class on my own data
- Get better at commenting my code

# Tess "Best hair superlative champion," Sameshima

## Challenges faced along the way
- Technological issues 
  - Version control
  - Multi OS nomenclature
  - Error bars

## Victories and things to celebrate
- Technological work arounds
  - More familiar with path settings
  - General code interpretation and debugging improvements 
  
## Challenges you are still facing
- Fluid coding
- More error feed back comprehension 

## Next R hurdle to tackle
- Using R to analyze data collected in MATLAB
- Using R for my master's project

# Scott "Dad jokes for days," Wallner

## Challenges faced along the way
- data wrangling
  - cleaning name 
  - large data sets
  - many separate data files for participants and conditions
  - needed to use both long and wide formats

## Victories and things to celebrate
- making GIFs
- super neat plots
- research question was answered
- hypothesis was correct
- using R to make this presentation

## Challenges you are still facing
- make some plots prettier

## Next R hurdle to tackle
- remove outliers and re-run analysis
- run a power analysis
- work with the "random" data
- adapt and develop the study
- run an online study
- replicate with cellular automata and 3D dynamic fractals

# Project Background and Introduction

## What are fractals?

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

:::{}
- Invented by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980
- *"Clouds are not spheres. Mountains are not triangles."*
- Measure of "roughness" called dimension
- Self similarity and scale invariance
- Mathematically or algorithmically generated
